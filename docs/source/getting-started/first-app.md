# Protecting your first app

This guide shows you how to protect an internal service with Gatekeeper using nginx.

## How it works

Nginx uses the `auth_request` directive to check authentication before serving requests. For each request:

1. Nginx sends a subrequest to Gatekeeper's `/api/v1/auth/validate` endpoint
2. Gatekeeper checks the session cookie
3. If valid, Gatekeeper returns `200 OK` and nginx serves the request
4. If invalid, Gatekeeper returns `401` and nginx redirects to the sign-in page

## Prerequisites

- Gatekeeper running and accessible
- nginx installed on your server
- An internal app you want to protect

## Step 1: Register the app

First, register your app with Gatekeeper:

```bash
uv run gk apps add --slug myapp --name "My Internal App"
```

The slug is a URL-safe identifier used in access control.

## Step 2: Grant yourself access

Grant your admin user access to the app:

```bash
uv run gk apps grant --slug myapp --email you@example.com
```

## Step 3: Configure nginx

Add this configuration to nginx. Replace the placeholders with your actual values.

```nginx
# Gatekeeper auth endpoint (internal only)
location = /_gatekeeper/validate {
    internal;
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/validate;
    proxy_pass_request_body off;
    proxy_set_header Content-Length "";
    proxy_set_header X-Original-URI $request_uri;
    proxy_set_header X-GK-App "myapp";  # Your app slug
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header Cookie $http_cookie;
}

# Your protected app
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name myapp.example.com;

    # SSL configuration...

    location / {
        auth_request /_gatekeeper/validate;

        # On 401, redirect to sign-in
        error_page 401 = @signin;

        # On 403, show access denied
        error_page 403 = @denied;

        # Pass the authenticated user to your app
        auth_request_set $auth_user $upstream_http_x_auth_user;
        proxy_set_header X-Auth-User $auth_user;

        # Proxy to your app
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    }

    location @signin {
        return 302 https://auth.example.com/signin?redirect=$scheme://$host$request_uri;
    }

    location @denied {
        return 302 https://auth.example.com/access-denied;
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Reload nginx

Test and reload the configuration:

```bash
nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## Step 5: Test it

1. Open your app URL in a browser (e.g., `https://myapp.example.com`)
2. You should be redirected to the Gatekeeper sign-in page
3. Sign in with your email
4. After signing in, you're redirected back to your app

## Using the authenticated user

Gatekeeper passes the user's email in the `X-Auth-User` header. Your app can read this to know who's making the request.

Example in Python/Flask:

```python
from flask import request

@app.route("/")
def index():
    user_email = request.headers.get("X-Auth-User")
    return f"Hello, {user_email}!"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Getting 401 even when signed in

- Check that the `Cookie` header is being passed to Gatekeeper
- Verify `COOKIE_DOMAIN` matches your app's domain
- Check browser dev tools for the session cookie

### Getting 403 Forbidden

- Verify the user has access to the app: `gk apps show --slug myapp`
- Grant access if missing: `gk apps grant --slug myapp --email user@example.com`

### Redirect loop

- Make sure the sign-in page itself isn't protected by `auth_request`
- Gatekeeper's own endpoints should not require authentication
